# Travel App

Project Overview
------------

The goal of this Udacity project was to combine all of the previous lessons into one final capstone project.

According to the Udactiy Introduction:

"This project requires you to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs."


Project Main Challenges
------------

The following are just some of the questions that you’ll experience along the way:

* What’s the ideal workflow?
* How many files do I need?
* How do I convert one project into another?
* Should I redo the HTML/CSS first or go straight to the javascript?
* How many JavaScript functions do I need?
* Should my function be this many lines of code?
* Is readability or performance more important?
